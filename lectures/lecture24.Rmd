## Review

* Shiny: Dynamic display of data
* Three parts: UI, Server, Reactive Programming
* UI
  * consistent layout of app (usually composed using `fluidPage` and `fluidRow`)
  * place `input*` and `output*` with ids that map to the `input$ID` and `output$ID` in `server`
  * interactive graphics
  * basic text and number input
  * sliders for ranged values
* Widget gallery is a nice view of the different basic tools
* [Shiny Homepage](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) (the gallery is a neat set of examples)
* [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html)

## Inputs for categorical data

When we have a set of categories we want for input, we have two options:

* Radio buttons: only one can be selected
* Check boxes: many can be selected

In both cases, we'll give a set of choices of the form: `c("Nice display name 1" = "option1", "Nice display name 2" = "option2", ...)`

See `checkbox_mpg.R`.

## Exercise

Use `radioButtons` (same basic interface as `inputCheckboxGroup`) to select two numeric variables from the `mpg` table to graph against each other.

Bonus: if the selected variables are the same, graph as a density instead of a jitter.

See `example_radio.R`.

## `outputXYZ` and `renderXYZ` functions

Once we get the input we need, it's time to get it back to the user. Within the UI, we place the output using various `outputXYZ` functions:

* `htmlOutput()/uiOutput()`
* `imageOutput()` (static image from a file)
* `plotOutput()` (R plots)
* `textOutput()` HTML text
* `verbatimTextOutput()` non-rendered text
* `tableOuput()/dataTableOutuput()` tables (`dataTable` version has interactive elements)
* several others for download links, dialog boxes, etc

We need to create these outputs using corresponding `renderXYZ` functions

* `renderUI`
* `renderImage`
* `renderPlot`
* `renderPrint/renderText` (print verison captures output, text version takes a string vector as the return value)
* `renderTable/renderDataTable`

## Including HTML in output

If you know some basic HTML, you can include it the output.

The `ul` tag starts and ends bulleted lists. `li` tags delimit individual items in the list.

See `input_song_html.R`

## Including Markdown

See `input_song_markdown.R`

## Shiny in RMarkdown documents

Go to RStudio...

## Exercise

Open `exercise_markdown.R` and follow the comments.

## Manipulating user inputs

When users update values on inputs this generates **events**. We get notifications of events using `observeEvent(input$element, { code })`. Then we can use `update*` functions.

See `slider_update_update.R`

## Making web apps that feel like real apps

Web App Goal: make a series of web pages feel like an interactive application

Why is this difficult?

* Client/server architecture
* Keeping state persistent
* Avoid having to transfer lots of data
* Avoid re-running lots of computations on server
* Keep manageable for the programmer

## Reactive programming

We already saw **event driven programming** where we could respond to changes to UI.

In **reactive programming** we also allow variables to react to changes in other variables.

Downside: we have to use a few more tools than just regular R variables.

## Reactive variables: function like objects

Variables (boxes to hold data) in Shiny's reactive framework look and behave much like functions.

```{r}
reactiveConsole(TRUE) # use this for interactive testing

rv <- reactiveVal(999) # initial value
rv() # get the value
rv(1) # set the value
rv()
```

## Reactive contexts

You may recall that when we use `render*` functions or `update*` functions we executed code inside of `{...}`. This formed a **reactive context**. A wrapper around code that connects reactive variables.

```{r}
rv2 <- reactive({
  message("updating rv2")
  rv() - 10
})

# get inital value
rv2()

# now value is stored
rv2() + 1

# does not immediately update rv2
rv(123)

# only runs code when needed
rv2()
```

## Multiple comparisons/multiple testing

![XKCD 882](images/significant.png)

## Hypothesis Testing

In the previous comic, the scientists were reporting that they (mostly) failed to reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation at the **$\alpha = 0.05$ significance level** by noting that the $p$-value of the test was greater than 0.05.

This works for a single test because when the null hypothesis is true, the $p$-value has a 5% probability of being less than 0.05, which makes sure we don't commit a Type I error (reject true null hypothesis) in more than 5% of samples.

More generally, this holds for any signficance level $\alpha$.

## Bonferroni Corrections

But when we perform multiple tests, this logic no longer holds.

If we perform $k$ (independent tests), the probability that we make at least one Type I error becomes $1 - (1 - \alpha)^k$.

```{r}
1 - (1 - 0.05)^5
```
 
With a Bonferroni correction, we simply divide $\alpha$ by $k$ (which can be slightly conservative):
```{r}
1 - (1 - 0.05/5)^5
```

Now it is harder to reject each individual hypothesis, but overall our **family-wise error rate** is (strongly) protected.

## Example

```{r}
set.seed(39422200)

n <- 100
k <- 1000
y <- rnorm(n)
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * k), ncol = k) |> as.data.frame()

pvs <- map_dbl(x, ~ cor.test(y, .x)$p.value)
mean(pvs < 0.05)

```

## `reactiveEvent`

In order to get access to user actions, we can use the `reactiveEvent` function.

See `bonferroni.R`

## Shiny Next Steps

Lots more to learn!

- More reactive programming tools
- Tabs/multipage apps
- Add on packages
- Deployment to the web
